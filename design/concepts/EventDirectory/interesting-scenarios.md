[@20251015_004308.7f181eec](../../../context/design/concepts/EventDirectory/implementation.md/20251015_004308.7f181eec.md) When I forgot the include the spec, context generated its own and implemented it.

[@20251015_004924.d9af7b12](../../../context/design/concepts/EventDirectory/implementation.md/20251015_004924.d9af7b12.md) First few attempts had many TypeScript/deno errors. This was my first concept I implemented, so very much a learning process.

[@20251015_010643.0bc765fd](../../../context/design/concepts/EventDirectory/testing.md/20251015_010643.0bc765fd.md) Despite being provided the file describing how to test concepts, context did not know to use Deno here.

[@20251015_025223.aa7e93f2](../../../context/design/concepts/EventDirectory/debugging.md/20251015_025223.aa7e93f2.md) Attempting to debug by providing error logs and the implementation and tests that caused it went awfully. I gave up using context to debug and instead went back to implementation.md and testing.md and provided better prompts.
