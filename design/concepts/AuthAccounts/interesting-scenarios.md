[@20251015_034314.0add8819](../../../context/design/concepts/AuthAccounts/testing.md/20251015_034314.0add8819.md) when making test cases, a lot less syntax errors showed upn and the test cases were divided up more clearly when *not* prompted to  follow a certain sequence of actions (and letting context figure out a sequence on its own)
