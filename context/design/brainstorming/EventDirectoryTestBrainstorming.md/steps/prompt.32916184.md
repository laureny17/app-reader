# prompt: Observing the sample concept LikertSurvey and how a ~10 step long trace, demonstrating how the principle of the LikertSurvey concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions, was written for LikertSurvey, brainstorm a similarly in-depth and similar-length trace for the EventDirectory concept, in line with the current spec. Do not implement the actual concept or test suite in code; only provide the trace in bullet points in Markdown.
