# prompt: Observe how tests were structured for the sample LikertSurvey concept here ([@LikertSurvey-concept-tests](/src/concepts/LikertSurvey/LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts)) and create a test suite that works with the Deno testing framework and covers a full trace that  demonstrates how the principle of the concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions. Ensure that no tests use or depend on ANY other concepts besides AuthAccounts itself. Do not test any behavior that requires cross-concept interaction.
