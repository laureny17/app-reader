# prompt: Observe how tests were structured for the sample LikertSurvey concept and edit the EventDirectory test file to work with the Deno testing framework without at all rewriting or editing the content of the test cases. Do not change any of the content or add additional test cases or unnecessary imports; only add minimal lines to make the file compatible for Deno testing.
