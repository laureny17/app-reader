# prompt: Based on the provided error logs, and the updated implementation ([@implementation-file](src/concepts/EventDirectory/EventDirectoryConcept.ts)), if there are any, fix possible issues in the test suite ([@test-file](src/concepts/EventDirectory/EventDirectoryConcept.test.ts)), or any discrepancies between the the implementation and test suite. Make minimal changes. Neither file should use ANY other concepts; this includes NOT using AuthAccounts in both files. Only use testDb for the test file.
