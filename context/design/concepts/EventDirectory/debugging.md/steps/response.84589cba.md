# response:

The error logs indicate several key issues:

1. **Admin Check Failure:** Most actions fail with `error: "Only admins can..."`. This points to the `EventDirectoryConcept` not correctly verifying admin privileges. This is because the `_isAdmin` function, which `EventDirectoryConcept` needs to perform this check, was not properly passed to its constructor, or the `_isAdmin` function itself was not used correctly in the concept.
2. **`createEvent` Return Value:** The `createEvent` action returns `undefined` instead of an object containing the new `eventId`, causing `eventId1` in the test to be `undefined`. This subsequently affects many other tests that rely on `eventId1`.
3. **Mismatched Error Messages:** For negative test cases (e.g., adding a duplicate reader, removing a non-existent reader), the expected error messages in the test suite do not precisely match the messages returned by the concept, or they contain `undefined` where an actual `eventId` should be.
4. **Incorrect Reader Count in Final Verification:** After `readerA` is removed, the final assertion expects 2 memberships, but there should only be 1 (`readerB`).

## Solution:

The fixes involve:

1. **`EventDirectoryConcept.ts`:**
   * Modifying the constructor to accept an `_isAdmin` function as a dependency.
   * Adding an `_isAdmin` check at the beginning of all actions that require admin privileges.
   * Ensuring `createEvent` returns an object `{ eventId: newEvent._id }`.
   * Updating error messages in `addReader` and `removeReader` to be dynamic and precise, matching the test expectations.

2. **`EventDirectoryConcept.test.ts`:**
   * Passing a correctly wrapped `_isAdmin` function (from `AuthAccountsConcept`) to the `EventDirectoryConcept` constructor. The `AuthAccountsConcept._isAdmin` expects an object `{ userId: UserID }`, while `EventDirectoryConcept` expects a function `(id: UserID) => Promise<boolean>`. A small lambda function is used for adaptation.
   * Correctly assigning the `eventId1` variable from the result of `createEvent`.
   * Updating expected error messages in `assertEquals` calls for `addReader` and `removeReader` to precisely match the concept's output, including the dynamic `eventId1`.
   * Correcting the expected reader count in the final verification step.
